# Integrating-Scale-Free-Networks-into-Blockchain
This project explores the integration of scale-free network models, specifically the Barab√°si-Albert (BA) model, into a basic blockchain framework. It aims to analyze the impact of scale-free networks on blockchain performance metrics such as throughput and latency, comparing it against a simple blockchain setup without scale-free characteristics.
