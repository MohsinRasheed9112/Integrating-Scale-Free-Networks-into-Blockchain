# Scale-Free Blockchain Project

## Overview
This repository contains an approach to blockchain technology, incorporating scale-free network properties to investigate their effects on performance. By integrating the Barabasi-Albert model, known for its scale-free network characteristics, we examine how the topology of network connections influences blockchain efficiency, specifically focusing on throughput and latency.

## Features
- **Simple Blockchain Implementation**: A basic blockchain structure to serve as a control group in performance analysis.
- **Scale-Free Blockchain**: An enhanced blockchain model that incorporates scale-free network properties based on the Barab√°si-Albert model.
- **Performance Analysis**: Comparative metrics between the simple and scale-free blockchain implementations, focusing on throughput and latency.

## Getting Started
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
